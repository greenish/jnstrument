Realtime JavaScript Visualization
------------------

The project aims to give people who do not programm themselves,
an idea and an image of what happens behind the user interface
of a website. The goal is to let the user experience rather than explain
to him/her what happens when for example a button is clicked
or a page is scrolled.

Three visualizations show different aspects of the javascript
function-network that is build by the developers and executed when 
the user interacts with the website.

#### Technologies:
* A __Google Chrome Extension__, that injects Javascript on the website that will be visualized
* and a __NodeJS Server__, that serves the visualizations and forwards events from the webseite to the visualization.
